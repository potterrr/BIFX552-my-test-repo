When you down load files to your hard drive (e.g. in 
Swcarpentry, on the setup lesson, we download a zip file called 
data-shell.zip.)  data-shell.zip gets unpacked into a directory on the 
C: drive.  Unfortunately, Unix does not have drive letters.  That means there is no
way to get files from C://Users/Richard/Downloads/data-shell.zip to home directory of Unix.  **Except with the use of the command*mount*.  Mkdir c; mount c: /c; creates a directory c and then uses c for the c: drive.
